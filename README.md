# Flight-delay-analysis
I studied flight ontime performance data which is accessable at the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Short_Name=On-Time&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&Link=0&DB_URL=Mode_ID=1&Mode_Desc=Aviation&Subject_ID2=0).
     Based on all 5.5 million domestic flights from 2016 I generated a  flight delay
     prediction model for flights within the USA. The size of the analyzed dataset is 600 MB.
     
       An application runs on heroku with a web interface [ONTIMEPREDICTOR](http://flightontimeprediction.herokuapp.com/)
       and the code can be found on github [thedatabeat](https://github.com/thedatabeat/Flighdelay).
       
       The dataset has 83% ontime flights, therefore if one predicts every flight ontime the
       percentage of correctly  predicted ontime flights is 83%.
      
       In the model provided, the percentage of correctly prediced ontime flights is 89%.
       The area under curve (AUC) score  is 0.67.
       
         After testing various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression,
         support vector machines, random forest, neural networks, AdaBoost and gradient boosting,
         I choose logistic regression to generate the model.  The other more sophisticated models did not generate better results due to
         insufficient structure in the data therefore I applied Occam's razor.
        All the analysis is made on python using various libaries such as [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and
[sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/).
